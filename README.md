# Week-2-BootStrap-Homework

Made several lines of code for about me and portfolio. Floated portfolio images in a container that seperates them and its 2 pictures per row and are in two coloums.
Contact Page is used in cards  with several fourms that work and a submit button that doesnt submit anything as of yet. All links are working properly and connect to the correct pages when clicked also each header corresponds to each page that your are on. Dont have any actual pictures of myself so used images ive hused in the past for online fourums and other things. Also made responisve images that work when the page shrinks or gets larger also works on mobile devices correctly. the navigation bar is also resposive and turns into a little dropdown box when the screen hits a certin size as well at it still works correctly.
